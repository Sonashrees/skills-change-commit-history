# Remove commit history

Accidental commits can be tricky to remove with Git. In this GitHub Skills course, you'll use BFG Repo-Cleaner to change the history of a Git repository. You can apply what you learn in this course to fully remove sensitive material from your own repository.

## Step 2: Removing a file from Git history using BFG Repo-Cleaner

_You removed `.env` from the repository's root directory! :tada:_

Now that we've deleted the file, people that browse the repository on GitHub.com or anyone looking at just the head commit won't see the file. However, due to Git's nature, the file is still present in the history. In this step, we'll work on removing the file from the repository history.

**What is a _head commit_**? In Git, HEAD points to a branch or a commit. When we say [head commit](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#head), we usually mean the most recent commit in the repository's history.

There are multiple tools available for removing Git history, we'll use BFG Repo-Cleaner in this step. You can find additional documentation on [Using the BFG in GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#using-the-bfg).

**What is _BFG Repo-Cleaner_**? BFG Repo-Cleaner is software that can help you search through and alter repository history. Git can natively do this using [`git filter-repo`](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#using-git-filter-repo), but it can be more complex.

## Step 3: Avoiding future commits with `.env`

_Nice work removing the file from entire history of the repository! :sparkles:_

The steps we've taken so far ensure that any _new_ clones of the repository don't contain the sensitive data. But what about collaborators that may already have a copy of the repository? You should ask anyone with a copy of the repository to delete it and clone the repository fresh. In a real-life scenario, you'd also take [additional steps](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#fully-removing-the-data-from-github) to ensure no sensitive data is cached on GitHub.com.

Now that we've mitigated the risk of exposing sensitive content, we'll be proactive and prevent its addition.

We'll now configure Git so it ignores a future addition of sensitive content by adding `.env` to `.gitignore`. If someone should that file to the local copy of their repository, it will remain only on the contributor's machine and won't be pushed to GitHub.

**What is `.gitignore`?** This special file allows us to tell Git naming patterns to ignore. You can read more about it in [Ignoring files on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files).

### :keyboard: Activity: Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
>>>>>>> 6e7d162dc9d0787ba124b0a0204b2172fc167a8f

1. Update the local copy of your repository to ensure you have the most recent version of the course files.
   ```shell
   git pull
   ```
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Install BFG Repo-Cleaner on your machine. You can follow the [instructions on the web site](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to do so or you can use a package manager for your operating system.
3. Confirm the `.env` file is removed from the root directory. The command should return empty.
   ```shell
   find . -name ".env"
   ```
4. Search for .env in the repository's history. The command should return at least 2 commits: the addition of `.env` when you copied this template repository, and the removal of `.env`.
   ```shell
   git log --stat --all -- .env
   ```
5. Use BFG Repo-Cleaner to delete all references to `.env` that exist in the repository.
   ```shell
   bfg --delete-files .env
   ```
6. The tool will run and make some suggestions about some follow-up commands. Run those to get your local repository cleaned up.
7. Repeat the search for `.env` in the repository's history. This time, the command should return empty.
   ```shell
   git log --stat --all -- .env
   ```
8. Push your changes to GitHub. Note we're using the `--force` argument in this step since we're altering Git history.
   ```shell
   git push --force
   ```
9. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
=======
2. Locate the file we added to the repository titled `.gitignore`.
3. Add `.env` to the file.
4. Stage, commit the file:
   ```shell
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "ignore .env files"
   ```
5. Push the file to GitHub.com
   ```shell
   git push
   ```
6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
